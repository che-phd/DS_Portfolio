0,"A fraudulent charge was made on the card and soon after reported. The fraudulent claim was denied and claimed the item was delivered to my address, which is false. 

I never made a purchase anywhere near the date of the transaction and never received a delivery after the date of the transaction. 

I was never contacted during the investigation and was only sent a denial letter. 

The card is less than a year old and all purchases were made either online or at our local XXXX 's store. The fraud is likely an internal issue among XXXX 's employees or their affiliates. 

FYI, we have purchased nearly {$20000.00} using this Lowe 's credit card during the 6 months or card ownership and the fraudulent portion was for {$340.00}, fraudulently charged well after the competition of our purchases."
1,"I have been working with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX since XX/XX/2022 to pay my debts.I 'm on Social Security XXXX and ran into some problems financially, this XXXXXXXX XXXX has been receiving payments monthly since XXXX granted they are late I do not get paid until the XXXX monthly from Social Security. And the funds go through XXXX XXXX, then sent onto Fortiva. I contacted XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX to ask for a date change for my payments so they aren't late anymore ( to stop their late fees and over the limit fees ) they refused. This account will never get caught up if they do not help with changing the payment dates, and refunding of late fees, and over limit fees, ( over limit fees that they created by changing me late payment charges ). I can NOT change my pay date it's straight across the board from the Government! They also refused to offer any hardship payment plan to me!"
2,Credit acceptance closed this account on my credit report then opened it back as late payments this information is incorrect and is illegal on how it is posted on my report. I have wrote them a certified letter twice asking them to remove this with no response for over 60 days.
3,"On Saturday XXXX, I received a Netspend XXXX XXXX pre-paid XXXX This card includes an account and a mailer to sign up for Direct Deposit, which included a routing number and an account number. When I called the company on XXXX, their phone system lead me in circles. When I looked on their website, they did not list any phone numbers that would actually route me to a person. The phone system wanted me to activate the card before anyone would help me. So, I routed through the phone system to report a lost or stolen card before I could speak to a person. When I did speak to a person, they wanted me to activate this card, even though I did not request it. I had to request to speak to a supervisor to find out who requested the card account on my behalf. The supervisor said that it was a promotional item, and they just send these cards to randomly selected people. I explained that this was deceptive marketing, and it was fraudulent because they sent out a completely encoded XXXX with my name, and active magnetic strip. I had to request the company cancel this card as well as the account, to remove me from all future mailing, to not give or sell my information to anyone, and to remove my information from their database. This is very deceptive and could defraud many people."
4,"I request you provide me with proof of this alleged payment being late. if unable to provide or lacking proof of this payment being late, update payment history to paid as agreed never late ( PAANL ) Please provide detailed description of all procedures used in your process to determine complete accuracy of information once you have finished your investigation, send me an update credit report to the address above"
5,"In review of my XXXX credit report on XX/XX/XXXX, I noticed a XXXX ( XXXX ) collections accounts from a company by the name of Credit Collection Services. I had never heard of them before nor received any writtenc communication from them. On XX/XX/XXXX I contacted this company via XXXX Mail to "" Validate '' this debt. I received the green certified card that revealed that the company received my letter. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I noticed that XXXX of the XXXX ( XXXX ) accounts that I had disputed was removed and I had not received an official response from them. I drafted another letter to them on XX/XX/XXXX informing them that they were in direct violation of the federal consumer law. I sent this letter to them via XXXX Mail as well. 

As to this date, I have still not received any response from them. Furthermore, they have violated the FDCPA Regulation F that became effective XX/XX/XXXX."

7,"- My husband and I got a Reverse Mortgage in XXXX, tenure monthly payments. 
- We did a refi that was completed on XX/XX/XXXX. Our house had almost doubled in value. 
- On XX/XX/XXXX my husband left me and the house permanently. 
- On XX/XX/XXXX our divorce was final. 
- On XX/XX/XXXX I submitted documents requested by Reverse Mortgage Lending LLC : - Divorce Decree making the Reverse Mortgage Loan 100 % my responsibilty, /liability. XXXX XXXX fully understands this. 
- My husband 's Quit Claim on the house. 
- My husbands letter revoking all interest in the reverse mortgage loan. 

- On XX/XX/XXXX I contacted Reverse Mortgage Funding LLC to convert the monthly payments to a Line of Credit. I needed funds to buy my x-husband out of his half of the house as set forth in the Divorce Decree. Forms were to be sent to me. 
- On XX/XX/XXXX I received the forms : 'Modification of Home Equity Conversion Loan Agreement ' and 'Line of Credit Draw Request Form '. 
- On XX/XX/XXXX I called XXXX XXXX to ask if my ex-husband has to sign on the XXXXBorrower ' lines of both forms. When the customer service person read his Letter of Revocation, she said "" NO he does not have to sign it ''. I faxed the Modification form to XXXX XXXX. 
- On XX/XX/XXXX I was informed by XXXX XXXX that my ex-husband has to sign the Modification form and any Withdrawal Request forms even though : He is no longer an owner of the house via Quit Claim Deed. 
He no longer resides in the house and never will again. 
He has revoked all interest in the loan ( as part of the Divorce Decree ).

I have taken full responsibility for the Loan ( as part of the Divorce Decree ). 
- XXXX XXXX is saying that he has to sign everything from now on because his name is on the Loan Contract. 
- XXXX XXXX is saying that they can't remove his name from the Contract. 
- XXXX is saying that the ONLY way to remove his name from the Contract is for me to REFI a new loan in my name. 

- There are several problems with my doing a REFI : - One can not REFI twice in the same year. 
- If a REFI is not in the best interrest of the applicant, it is against the law for a company to recommend REFI or to go through the process. 
- Since our REFI in XX/XX/XXXX, our house has lost some value and interest rates have gone up considerably. 
- If I were to do a REFI ( about {$10000.00} in cost which would benefit only XXXX XXXX ), I SHOULD be denied because it would be a financially inferior loan with less equity value at a higher interest rate, post-divorce. That is not in my best interrest. 
- XXXX XXXX says that I now have only 2 options : - Have my ex-husband sign all forms, remaining a party to the loan which is inappropriate and in violation of the Divorce Decree.

- Or do a REFI to their benefit and to no other party.

- So either my ex-husband remains on the loan with unlawful control and liability or I am forced to do a REFI which puts me in a significantly worse position financially, is against the law and I should be denied. 
- Then what? 

- I think XXXX XXXX has the power to make an exception for my case, including removing my ex-husbands name from the Contract. 
- By signing the Modification and Withdrawal forms, my ex-husband is signing up for more risk when he doesn't own the house. He doesn't reside in the home and has revoked all of his interest in the Loan via Washington State courts. 

- I think XXXX XXXX can choose to work with me instead of leaving me in a position now where at XXXX XXXX XXXX, I am likely going to have to sell my home, leave my community and relocate somewhere into a substantially lower status of living. While I am fortunate to have inherited longevity, my finances need to last decades longer meaning my dependency on XXXX XXXX making decisions complying with intersecting laws such as Dissolution of Marriage puts me in a genuinely vulnerable position. I have complied with all relevant laws thus far. Why should XXXX XXXX be able to choose profit over fair practice? 

- I have not attached those Decree documents here, according to the guidance on this website, as my name and contact information and my ex-husbands as well, are emberdded in those documents. 

I appreciate your bureau 's role is resolving this kind of situation. 
Thank you"
8,Credit Acceptance continues to disregard my complaints by saying that I'm making duplicate complaints when in reality each complaint has been singular and due to continuous verbal abuse expressed by credit acceptance and unfair treatment. Credit Acceptance is threatening repossession and damage of my credit report as well as my husband 's credit report which credit acceptance has yet to fix. I am still being affected by Covid 19 and credit acceptance explained that consumers will be protected as long as we communicate that we are affected. Credit Acceptance is being unfair and abusive towards me and my husband XXXX XXXX.
9,"US Bank Loss Draft Department Hurricane Ian Flooded my home, flood insurance cut a check and I sent to Mortgage company. The company sent me a check for XXXX dollars- I deposited the check they cancelled it. I have contractors lined up and the company will not explain the issue or why I was given the check and it was then taken away. I was able to call and they stated their policy changed. I called on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX and XXXX stated I would get a check for the total amount, called back on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX stated the check was mailed and at my home. I deposited the check on XX/XX/XXXX. I was notified by my bank on XX/XX/XXXX that the payment was stopped. I still haven't received notification from the company or a supervisor of why this occurred. I have a letter saying final disbursement was given and claims is complete. I have contractors coming next week and I won't have money to pay them to get my home where I can live in my home. I was able to get notification after multiple calls today that they would send XXXX for repairs. The problem I have is the poor information shared so I can plan to fix my investment ( home ) and the lack of communication and cancelling funds so my checks are going to bounce without that money and I will have to pay additional fees due to the incompetence of this bank."
