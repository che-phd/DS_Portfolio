0,"A fraudulent charge was made on the card and soon after reported. The fraudulent claim was denied and claimed the item was delivered to my address, which is false. 

I never made a purchase anywhere near the date of the transaction and never received a delivery after the date of the transaction. 

I was never contacted during the investigation and was only sent a denial letter. 

The card is less than a year old and all purchases were made either online or at our local XXXX 's store. The fraud is likely an internal issue among XXXX 's employees or their affiliates. 

FYI, we have purchased nearly {$20000.00} using this Lowe 's credit card during the 6 months or card ownership and the fraudulent portion was for {$340.00}, fraudulently charged well after the competition of our purchases."
1,"I have been working with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX since XX/XX/2022 to pay my debts.I 'm on Social Security XXXX and ran into some problems financially, this XXXXXXXX XXXX has been receiving payments monthly since XXXX granted they are late I do not get paid until the XXXX monthly from Social Security. And the funds go through XXXX XXXX, then sent onto Fortiva. I contacted XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX to ask for a date change for my payments so they aren't late anymore ( to stop their late fees and over the limit fees ) they refused. This account will never get caught up if they do not help with changing the payment dates, and refunding of late fees, and over limit fees, ( over limit fees that they created by changing me late payment charges ). I can NOT change my pay date it's straight across the board from the Government! They also refused to offer any hardship payment plan to me!"
2,Credit acceptance closed this account on my credit report then opened it back as late payments this information is incorrect and is illegal on how it is posted on my report. I have wrote them a certified letter twice asking them to remove this with no response for over 60 days.
3,"On Saturday XXXX, I received a Netspend XXXX XXXX pre-paid XXXX This card includes an account and a mailer to sign up for Direct Deposit, which included a routing number and an account number. When I called the company on XXXX, their phone system lead me in circles. When I looked on their website, they did not list any phone numbers that would actually route me to a person. The phone system wanted me to activate the card before anyone would help me. So, I routed through the phone system to report a lost or stolen card before I could speak to a person. When I did speak to a person, they wanted me to activate this card, even though I did not request it. I had to request to speak to a supervisor to find out who requested the card account on my behalf. The supervisor said that it was a promotional item, and they just send these cards to randomly selected people. I explained that this was deceptive marketing, and it was fraudulent because they sent out a completely encoded XXXX with my name, and active magnetic strip. I had to request the company cancel this card as well as the account, to remove me from all future mailing, to not give or sell my information to anyone, and to remove my information from their database. This is very deceptive and could defraud many people."
4,"I request you provide me with proof of this alleged payment being late. if unable to provide or lacking proof of this payment being late, update payment history to paid as agreed never late ( PAANL ) Please provide detailed description of all procedures used in your process to determine complete accuracy of information once you have finished your investigation, send me an update credit report to the address above"
5,"In review of my XXXX credit report on XX/XX/XXXX, I noticed a XXXX ( XXXX ) collections accounts from a company by the name of Credit Collection Services. I had never heard of them before nor received any writtenc communication from them. On XX/XX/XXXX I contacted this company via XXXX Mail to "" Validate '' this debt. I received the green certified card that revealed that the company received my letter. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I noticed that XXXX of the XXXX ( XXXX ) accounts that I had disputed was removed and I had not received an official response from them. I drafted another letter to them on XX/XX/XXXX informing them that they were in direct violation of the federal consumer law. I sent this letter to them via XXXX Mail as well. 

As to this date, I have still not received any response from them. Furthermore, they have violated the FDCPA Regulation F that became effective XX/XX/XXXX."

7,"- My husband and I got a Reverse Mortgage in XXXX, tenure monthly payments. 
- We did a refi that was completed on XX/XX/XXXX. Our house had almost doubled in value. 
- On XX/XX/XXXX my husband left me and the house permanently. 
- On XX/XX/XXXX our divorce was final. 
- On XX/XX/XXXX I submitted documents requested by Reverse Mortgage Lending LLC : - Divorce Decree making the Reverse Mortgage Loan 100 % my responsibilty, /liability. XXXX XXXX fully understands this. 
- My husband 's Quit Claim on the house. 
- My husbands letter revoking all interest in the reverse mortgage loan. 

- On XX/XX/XXXX I contacted Reverse Mortgage Funding LLC to convert the monthly payments to a Line of Credit. I needed funds to buy my x-husband out of his half of the house as set forth in the Divorce Decree. Forms were to be sent to me. 
- On XX/XX/XXXX I received the forms : 'Modification of Home Equity Conversion Loan Agreement ' and 'Line of Credit Draw Request Form '. 
- On XX/XX/XXXX I called XXXX XXXX to ask if my ex-husband has to sign on the XXXXBorrower ' lines of both forms. When the customer service person read his Letter of Revocation, she said "" NO he does not have to sign it ''. I faxed the Modification form to XXXX XXXX. 
- On XX/XX/XXXX I was informed by XXXX XXXX that my ex-husband has to sign the Modification form and any Withdrawal Request forms even though : He is no longer an owner of the house via Quit Claim Deed. 
He no longer resides in the house and never will again. 
He has revoked all interest in the loan ( as part of the Divorce Decree ).

I have taken full responsibility for the Loan ( as part of the Divorce Decree ). 
- XXXX XXXX is saying that he has to sign everything from now on because his name is on the Loan Contract. 
- XXXX XXXX is saying that they can't remove his name from the Contract. 
- XXXX is saying that the ONLY way to remove his name from the Contract is for me to REFI a new loan in my name. 

- There are several problems with my doing a REFI : - One can not REFI twice in the same year. 
- If a REFI is not in the best interrest of the applicant, it is against the law for a company to recommend REFI or to go through the process. 
- Since our REFI in XX/XX/XXXX, our house has lost some value and interest rates have gone up considerably. 
- If I were to do a REFI ( about {$10000.00} in cost which would benefit only XXXX XXXX ), I SHOULD be denied because it would be a financially inferior loan with less equity value at a higher interest rate, post-divorce. That is not in my best interrest. 
- XXXX XXXX says that I now have only 2 options : - Have my ex-husband sign all forms, remaining a party to the loan which is inappropriate and in violation of the Divorce Decree.

- Or do a REFI to their benefit and to no other party.

- So either my ex-husband remains on the loan with unlawful control and liability or I am forced to do a REFI which puts me in a significantly worse position financially, is against the law and I should be denied. 
- Then what? 

- I think XXXX XXXX has the power to make an exception for my case, including removing my ex-husbands name from the Contract. 
- By signing the Modification and Withdrawal forms, my ex-husband is signing up for more risk when he doesn't own the house. He doesn't reside in the home and has revoked all of his interest in the Loan via Washington State courts. 

- I think XXXX XXXX can choose to work with me instead of leaving me in a position now where at XXXX XXXX XXXX, I am likely going to have to sell my home, leave my community and relocate somewhere into a substantially lower status of living. While I am fortunate to have inherited longevity, my finances need to last decades longer meaning my dependency on XXXX XXXX making decisions complying with intersecting laws such as Dissolution of Marriage puts me in a genuinely vulnerable position. I have complied with all relevant laws thus far. Why should XXXX XXXX be able to choose profit over fair practice? 

- I have not attached those Decree documents here, according to the guidance on this website, as my name and contact information and my ex-husbands as well, are emberdded in those documents. 

I appreciate your bureau 's role is resolving this kind of situation. 
Thank you"
8,Credit Acceptance continues to disregard my complaints by saying that I'm making duplicate complaints when in reality each complaint has been singular and due to continuous verbal abuse expressed by credit acceptance and unfair treatment. Credit Acceptance is threatening repossession and damage of my credit report as well as my husband 's credit report which credit acceptance has yet to fix. I am still being affected by Covid 19 and credit acceptance explained that consumers will be protected as long as we communicate that we are affected. Credit Acceptance is being unfair and abusive towards me and my husband XXXX XXXX.
9,"US Bank Loss Draft Department Hurricane Ian Flooded my home, flood insurance cut a check and I sent to Mortgage company. The company sent me a check for XXXX dollars- I deposited the check they cancelled it. I have contractors lined up and the company will not explain the issue or why I was given the check and it was then taken away. I was able to call and they stated their policy changed.

I deposited the check on XX/XX/XXXX. I was notified by my bank on XX/XX/XXXX that the payment was stopped. I still haven't received notification from the company or a supervisor of why this occurred. I have a letter saying final disbursement was given and claims is complete. I have contractors coming next week and I won't have money to pay them to get my home where I can live in my home. I was able to get notification after multiple calls today that they would send XXXX for repairs. The problem I have is the poor information shared so I can plan to fix my investment ( home ) and the lack of communication and cancelling funds so my checks are going to bounce without that money and I will have to pay additional fees due to the incompetence of this bank."
10,"In XX/XX/2022 in response to a Citi direct mail ad, I opened up a new Checking Account with Citi and deposited {$200000.00} cash.

The insurance company notified me that they returned {$1200.00} to Loancare on XXXX XXXX.

I called XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and informed representative that my employer had not payed my direct deposit. I asked BridgeCrest to defer my payments for XX/XX/XXXX & XX/XX/XXXX. Furthermore, I asked representative if I had ever been 40 days past due on my auto loan and she said no, I asked her based her her experiences what are the chances of my payments getting deferred and she said she does not see it being a problem. Informed representative my employer would have to research where the deposits is. Representative processed my request for the deferred payments that were due on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX and said I would receive email with decision. Received email today and I was denied. The XXXX XXXX requires creditors to work with consumers that has harship paying on loan. I did the right thing and called Bridgecrest to have loan payments deferred and I was denied.

15,"Here is a timeline of events : Wednesday XXXX XX/XX/XXXX @ approx XXXX, I received a call from a woman claiming to be from The USAA Fraud department she explained that there was a charge in California that was flagged and she was calling to make sure that it was a valid charge from me. At the time of the call, I was on my way home from work and clearly not in California. She said that she would send me a new card and cancel the current one. At the moment this seemed fine to me because I had recently considered updating my card due to the expiration date drawing near. She asked that I confirm a code that she texted to me and said that I would receive the card the next day. 

Thursday XXXX XX/XX/XXXX @ approx XXXX, I received a call from my wife. Her card was declined while she was out making a purchase. She reviewed our accounts and was floored when saw that all of our savings and our 3 childrens savings accounts had been transferred to our checking account and all of our money was wire transferred out of our account. 

I called USAA and spoke with a representative who saw some additional movements actively happening. I asked if she could freeze our account and when I got home from work I would log into a desktop and call them back. I called back later that night and was told by a USAA representative, that my account was locked and under review by the fraud department. 

At this time there was {$500.00} left in our savings account. Because we had no money and did not know how long it would take, we removed {$400.00} via ATM so that we would have something to get by. 

Saturday XXXX XX/XX/XXXX @ approx XXXX, I received a call from the USAA/fraud department XXXX I was told that it was determined that there was no fraudulent activity and that I was responsible for the account as it stood. I was told that this decision was reached solely because we withdrew the {$400.00} from the ATM I called back a couple of hours later, in hopes to speak with a supervisor from the fraud department and was directed to a member of USAA security. She told me that reaching the fraud department wasnt possible. She explained that from what she could see, my account was still under investigation and that the person Id previously spoken with may not have been from USAA. 

Monday XXXX XX/XX/XXXX @ approx XXXX, I received a letter from USAA that stated I was responsible for the XXXX balance, as well as my savings and checking amounts that had been taken. It also said that USAA elects to no longer do business with me and my accounts would be terminated in 60 days. 

Since then, Ive made several calls to USAA and was able to see that the transactions from my account were wire transferred to a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX account that I have no association with. 

Ive contacted and informed XXXX XXXX, filed a police report with the XXXX XXXX  police department ( PR # XXXX ), initiated and case with the FTC ( XXXX # XXXX ), requested a credit freeze through XXXX, updated all of my banking login information, and requested new ATM/debit cards. 

There were XXXX wire transfers total to the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Account : - {$4300.00} - {$12000.00} - {$5000.00} - {$440.00} - {$200.00} We have yet to receive a letter from USAA detailing how their decision to hold us accountable was determined. 

Any help would be greatly appreciated."

20,"Hundreds of people are facing this issue. 
Your assistance in helping me may help hundreds if not thousands of others.

Please read the customer comments below this article post : XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX I and hundreds of others are being denied access to our money. 

Here is the crux of the matter : Citi XXXX locks a customer account. 

They then ask the customer to call in and ask to verify the customers phone number. 

CitiXXXX then tells the customer that they can not verify the phone number on file. This is a lie. They do this to many many people. The phone number is correct and with a large XXXX XXXX. CitiXXXX says the phone number is invalid and that the only way to verify and unlock the account is to wait up to 10 days to receive a physical piece of mail with a code. 

They are making hundreds of people wait to access their money until they receive a piece of mail. They lie that they can not verify the legitimate number on file neither via phone call or XXXX. 

This is unjust restriction of access to customer owned funds. This is an unjust and laborious and time consuming process to regain access to customer funds."

23,"I received my federal student loans on or around XXXX XX/XX/2022. After receiving the check via mail, I deposited the check for {$4700.00} via the USAA app. My money was put on a temporary hold, as is customary, and all funds made available after a few days. I spent the majority of the money furnishing my house over a 10 day span, at which point my debit card stopped working while getting groceries. 

USAA had not notified me of this issue, and my account showed no notifications or messages telling me what was happening ( it still doesnt. ) My emails had nothing from USAA aside from insurance payment info and spam. The only thing that let me know something was wrong were the words Balance Details Unavailable where my account value should be. 

I called USAA and after an hour on the phone, was told that I was under fraud investigation. When I asked why, the check was given as the reason. I asked why that would happen, because the check was from my college. The woman on the line did not know, and was as confused as I was. After some investigating online, I found similar cases - USAA locking customers accounts after depositing large checks. The checks go through on both ends, but USAA kicks them back regardless. 

Its been a week and I have no access to my funds. I have also been told that the check might be returned. Unfortunately, I have thrown away the original and will likely have to start the process of getting a new one. I am currently not able to pay for groceries, gas, or my sons daycare, which debits my account every week. In the event my check is kicked back, my account will be XXXX of dollars in debt while I wait for a new check. My XXXX XXXX housing allowance will go into my negative account, which means I will have no money for rent or utilities. If the check is not kicked back, I am still going on week two with no access to money that I signed for and that was cleared by both parties. 

My parents have banked with USAA my entire life. I chose USAA right before going to basic training and have been a loyal customer for the last seven years, both banking and insurance, but after this I will likely switch."
24,"I am a XXXX and in XXXXI applied for XXXX  tax exemption with my county tax assessor. It took 12 months for the exemption to process so my mortgage payment went up roughly {$700.00} a month. I continued to make my payments on time each month in XXXX to XXXX. Around XXXX of XXXX, the tax exemption went through, and my tax payment was cut by half. I turned in the proper paperwork to the mortgage company and sent request to have my escrow re-analyzed to reflect the correct tax payment. Being in Washington state, the mortgage company noted my escrow would be analyzed in XXXX each year. XX/XX/XXXX, I saw that the mortgage company processed the tax paperwork but still had not adjusted the monthly escrow amount due each month. I again requested to have my escrow analyzed and the mortgage company responded by asking me to refinance. XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX I asked to have the escrow analyzed and still nothing.

25,"I went to the Wells Fargo branch in XXXX on XXXX XXXX XXXX yesterday XX/XX/XXXX. I needed to get a US Treasury Form signed by a banking official per US Treasury instructions. The Form was a Bank Change Request Form FS XXXX that requires bank officials sign and specifically says a notary is not sufficient. Someone at WF signed the original form years ago when I opened the US Treasury acct. The WF employee told me after she researched with her support team that WF does not sign these forms. How can a federally charted bank get away with not signing a federal form to process a bank change with Treasury? I then spent three hours being transferred around WF when I called their customer support, and nobody could even acknowledge that they knew what a FS XXXX was?"
26,"On XXXX day of XX/XX/XXXX, an agreement was reached between XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX who unlawfully assigned rights to a third-party agency name American Finance the property description of a XXXX XXXX XXXX which is indeed used for personal, family, and household usage.

28,"On XX/XX/2022 I received a payoff from USAA of {$17000.00} on my credit card account. I then paid {$17000.00}, 100.00000 % of the payoff amount quoted. Note, not 99.99 % of the account but PAID OFF TO THE PENNY. USAA however provided an incorrect payoff amount to me. They later provided {$17000.00} which was the correct payoff amount. Hence the amount I was provided earlier was {$20.00} too low, an incorrect amount. As soon as I knew that we underpaid USAA, I immediately paid the {$20.00} which obviously was not an issue given that I had just paid such a large sum. USAA then reported to all credit bureaus the late payment of {$20.00} which we paid them 59 days after we learned they had given us an incorrect amount earlier. Paid in full should be paid in full. Our request of USAA is to note that the "" Consumer disputes late payment '' to allow the credit bureaus to not count this "" late '' payment in our XXXX score. USAA should not be allowed to give 100 % payoff amounts and later punish consumers for their mistake. This is factually and morally wrong. 
USAA agreed that the payment was in full and refunded my payment of the {$20.00} - see attached file."

I had a monthly auto-pay amount and when I changed from one credit union account to another, I neglected to update the autopay source with my new account but did so as soon as I was notified of "" declined funds '' from Citi. Though my source fund was updated on my Citi account, the autopay still had information from my previous ( now closed ) credit union account so the following month I received another "" declined funds '' notice and my account was immediately closed by Citi. This was clearly a Citibank error ; I did everything to update my financial source information, and was able to use those funds listed as my source funding to pay my balance as soon as I was notified of the acct issue -- I even got one of the reps on the phone to remove the {$29.00} "" bad check '' charge because she agreed Citi accounting was off.

I made ( XXXX ) payments which included a {$5000.00} fee which the loan new granted over the payoff amount of my consolidated federal student loans to ensure in possibly short on the payoff amount. The loan servicer was provided a payoff amount that offers up to 30 days to pay off the loan. Instead of {$5000.00} being sent to me directly, it was applied to the loan principle. I applied for a Forbearance shortly after losing my employee. A few days later, I got this response. 

Servicing XXXX Thu, XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX  to me Dear XXXX, Thank you for your recently submitted forbearance request. 

We recently received your forbearance request. The lender, XXXX XXXX XXXX, gave your request careful consideration and regrets that it can not approve the request at this time. 

REASONS FOR DENIAL. The factor ( XXXX ) below are the reason ( XXXX ) for this denial : ____ The borrower did not meet the minimum payment requirements ( either XXXX total consecutive payments before applying for his/her initial forbearance or making XXXX total consecutive payments between forbearance periods. ) If you have any additional questions, please get in touch with our XXXX XXXX  at XXXX Monday-Friday, XXXX XXXX- XXXX XXXX XXXX 
You can also contact us via email at : XXXX. 

Thank you, Customer Service XXXX XXXX. My first concern is that I was told by XXXX that the {$5000.00} that was approved over the payoff amount was applied to the principal balance is not considered a payment. ( Why not? Since surplus funds were never sent to me, I should have them applied directly to the loan. 

XXXX. I was told I must make XXXX payments before making a forbearance request. These specific terms were not included in the loan disclosure forms. 

XXXX. I was also told that the XXXX XXXX XXXX has the right to change the terms of forbearance at any point they choose to do so in the future."

During that time, my loan servicer was XXXX. I owed an amount of {$210000.00} to pay this loan in full. During the period of consolidation, Lendkey provided a payment amount of {$220000.00} to complete my private loan consolidation. This amount is {$5300.00}, over the amount required to pay off my federal student loan. When I asked Lendkey why they submitted the payment at a higher amount. I was told by LendKey customer service support that the additional fund was to ensure that any accrued interest was paid off.

1. My first concern is that all interest and payments on student loans are paused thru XX/XX/XXXX. Therefore there was no need for Lendkey to make this overpayment amount of {$5300.00}.

COVID-19 Loan Payment Pause and 0 % Interest In response to the COVID-19 emergency, we paused loan payments and set interest rates to 0 % for eligible federal student loans. On this page, you can find out if your loans are eligible and how this relief affects your loans. 

Student Loan Payment Pause Extended The student loan payment pause is extended until the U.S. Department of Education is permitted to implement the debt relief program, or the litigation is resolved. Payments will restart 60 days later. If the debt relief program has not been implemented and the litigation has not been resolved by XX/XX/XXXX payments will resume 60 days after that. We will notify borrowers before payments restart. 

COVID-19 Emergency Relief and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The additional {$5300.00} was applied directly to the principal balance ; no funds were transferred to me to fund the loan consolidation for the overpayment. 

3. I applied for forbearance in which {$530000.00} overpayment funds were not credited as ( 3 ) payments to my new consolidation loan payment, for which my standard payment amount is {$1700.00}.

4. Lendkey refused to approve my forbearance application because they stated I must make a minimum of 6 payments, in which I was not given credit for the {$5600.00} amount, which would equate to ( XXXX ) standard payments plus the payments I made on the account for the following months of XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. 

5. Lendkey essentially added {$5300.00} to my loan consolidation and did not provide me payment credit for the amount applied to the principal balance in which there was no additional accused interest because all Federal Student loan payments and interest are suspended thru XXXX."

I called the bank 's fraud claims department last week, and they confirmed both the date of my report and their denial of my claim. 

The Bank 's stated reason for denying my claim is that the claim was not made in a timely way, because prior to XX/XX/XXXX ( 1 ) statements covering these fraudulent charges were mailed to my home address, and ( 2 ) payments were made on this credit card account. It is true that payments have been timely made on this account. It is not the case that statements were mailed to my above address, though I do have access to online statements.

After speaking to the Bank, I called your office. Your representative confirmed the general rule that I have up to 60 days after you send a statement to bring a timely complaint concerning unauthorized transactions. She also informed me that a complaint brought after the 60-day window is still timely, unless the Bank can show that the fraudulent transactions would not have occurred if Id made my claim within the 60 day window. I asked specifically if there is an exception to this rule if I have received a statement detailing the fraudulent charges or pay the amount due on the statement before filing a claim with you. Your representative assured me, there is no such exception.

Most of the fraudulent charges referenced above were contained on a statement that was first made available to me within the 60-day period ending on XX/XX/XXXX. The Bank has provided me with no indication that it might have avoided any of these charges if Id informed them within 60 days of the date of the first statement containing these charges.

67,On XX/XX/XXXX my final payment was supposed to have been submitted I wanted to pay my last last payment because I had no correspondence with them for this hold year of XXXX and when I looked at my statement it had a balance of XXXX. I called them immediately gave the represented my new address and information found out that if they didn't even put it in the listing. I wanted to an explanation as to why my balance was so high after fulfilling the obligation of my contract I had XXXX  hey XXXX and I explained to them that I would not be able to work until I'm ready to go back to work and they said it would be okay so they read they had Rewritten my contract because during the covid process they said it would be any fees or no interest charge everything would be the same but apparently not and as of XXXX of XXXX I had made Seven payments and not one of them was deducted from my balance and I have the documents to show that. So would I talk to the representative he was telling me {$100.00} was going to the balance and the rest was going for the interest and fees but I didn't see that nowhere in the statements so I told them to send me a verification letter to show me the charges that they had supposedly had been charged me with and he sends me a statement instead of the actual breakdown of these charges that I have so called a crew and then looking back at the contract the contract was from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX which didn't make sense to me either because they were still ask for money after XXXX and so I waited for them to get back in touch with me they never to get back in touch with me cuz they said they was going to call me back to conclude the differences and they was going to show me the charges but they never did they didn't contact me at all from XXXX till now and the next thing I know my car was repossessed on XX/XX/XXXX now I've been charged every day that car is in there until something is done this is not right and this is how they do their their they're paying customers without any notification of a letter statement they got my email address and home address no corresponders whatsoever so we could have probably worked them out but I'm a senior citizen and I use my car that's my employment and I wanted something to be done about this

69,"CITIBANK IS DENYING ME ACCESS TO MY ACCOUNTS AND NO CAN SEEM TO FIX IT. MY ACCOUNTS ARE IN GOOD STANDING.I can not gain access to my credit card accounts and bank account with Citibank because when I try to log on it has a screen that keeps saying unless I activate my card I can not access ANY of my accounts. I have spent hours on the phone 2-4 hours and still not received any results. I NEED ACCESS TO MY ACCOUNTS!!! I have now called again today and been transferred twice and then the third time I was hung up on. NO ONE SEEMS TO KNOW HOW TO FIX THIS! Now I have been given a new phone number to call. I am just going to keep typing to give an example of my phone calls. Now they say they want information I can not access because I do all of my business online. I can not give them what they want because I can not access my account. Do you know your savings account number?? I don't maybe I should. But I can give them my security word, all of my credit card numbers every bit of information and now they are transferring me again. Oh now they have tried to tell me to go to a standing bank well there is not a single one where in my state that I can find. Only ATMS. They have now transferred me to a supervisor and she it telling me she can not help me that I need to call a different division back. And after explaining this again she now has either put me on hold or something without telling me. I am still connected but no one is talking to me. Now after 5 minutes of silence it hung up on me. So starting over with another phone call. Now they are saying it is because that card is expired as of TODAY. Well why did I not get a new one. They are saying they have no record of it being sent when I asked. I am being told that this is the problem. And, that they will send me a new card that I can put in this page that keeps blocking me. However they will not overnight it to me because they don't do that. They can only expedite it. I have tried to deal with this many times and now this is what they are saying will fix it. How come not one else was able to see this when I asked over and over again. This it totally a screwed up situation when you are being denied access to 4 different accounts because of one card that I can not find the number of because I likely cut it up because I would not use it and because of using only online banking I do not have paper statements of the actual account number. Oh and now I am transferred back to the credit card department when I said I wanted statements for my accounts. The person that transferred me said they could email me statements, now I am being told that they can only send them by mail. I explained that I do not want anything by mail because I have had things stolen in the past and my accounts accessed. I was told that I was being transferred to a supervisor. I ended up at tech support again. Which I have already talked to many times. AGAIN I feel like I am loosing my mind when I have to start over again. I feel like no one is listening when I have to repeat myself too with things I have already explained to the person I have been talking to. Like I already said I do not want statements mailed and then I am asked again by this same person if I want statements mailed because that I what they can do.

72,"On XX/XX/2022, the medical debt vulture company, First Financial Investment Fund III LLC, sent debt they purchased from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX XXXX. On XX/XX/2022, XXXX sent me a letter saying they were servicing the debt now. They call this their demand letter. There was no demand for payment, no option for a payment plan, nothing. Just a letter from a law group with a law group letterhead saying they service my debt now. This was intended to intimidate me. I sent back a letter to them disputing and asking for validation on XX/XX/2022. XXXX sent validation showing XXXX XXXX of purchased medical debt leading to XXXX XXXX XXXX between XX/XX/2022 and XX/XX/2022. But, by XX/XX/2022, XXXX XXXX XXXX had drawn up both validation and legal papers to sue me, filing the legal complaint 28 days after the dispute was received, with a summons ultimately issued on XX/XX/2022 in the XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX MI. Service was attempted the week of XX/XX/2022, but I was out of town. I called XXXX and spoke with XXXX on XX/XX/2022 who told me that I 'can ' respond to the summons after I am served, misrepresenting the fact that no answer virtually always means a judgment in their favor. I set up a payment arrangement that day, XX/XX/2022. They told me there was 'nothing ' they 'could do ' about dismissing the lawsuit because XXXX 's with the courts now. ' This is another lie. On XX/XX/2022, I paid in full and called the next week to ask whether this could get XXXX to serve me dismissal papers. They said the lawsuit was 'canceled ' and nothing else would happen with the lawsuit because I paid in full. This is yet another lie because I was served today, XX/XX/2022, over this fully paid debt. I believe they broke the law with the timeframe between my dispute and their lawsuit. I think they attempted to deceive me into not answering the court case. I think they lied by telling me they can't do anything to dismiss the case. I think they lied and will continue to try to collect on this debt to double, maybe even triple collect. If they're trying this with me, they've done it to others. Last, I think they are nothing but a law firm that uses incredibly deceptive and aggressive methods to collect for clients. They took my down payment for my first house for my children and gave it to corporate investors. I know it was my debt -- it was for the birth of my child -- but there was no offer for partial payment or even a payment plan before they filed legal paperwork. They should not exist."
73,"Please see the attached letter of dispute. Wells Fargo failed to communicate with me that a joint account was delinquent. They had contacted me in the past of a late payment and I brought the account current asap. Had they made any effort to reach me, a signer on the loan, I would have made sure it was paid. No mail, email, or phone call attempt to contact me. Furthermore, they only reported the one 30-day late payment, after almost a year with them. I had to call and ask for a third time that all the previous on-time payments be reported. Of which they have only reported a few at this point. The current credit reporting is incomplete and I want the 30-day late removed as I was unaware the payment was not made and they made no effort to advise me."
74,"First off, thank you in advance, for whatever assistance you can give me. 

Im in the middle of a dispute with XXXX XXXX XXXX regarding the payment for some lab work done in XX/XX/XXXX. The lab work was ordered by my Primary Physician, XXXX XXXX XXXX of XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ), and the blood was drawn by an XXXX technician. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I had blood drawn at the XXXX XXXX XXXX location as per XXXX XXXX instruction. For some reason the sample was sent out to XXXX XXXX XXXX for processing. According to XXXX XXXX ( XXXX Lab Mngr? ) the paperwork did not contain the appropriate Diagnostic Codes for all the types of analysis being requested, thus parts of the claim were denied by my Primary Health Insurers ( XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ). 

Sometime earlier this year I was approached by XXXX XXXX XXXX regarding this matter, and I attempted to resolve the problem myself. Unfortunately, I did not document my efforts and can not provide specifics as to whom I spoke or what I was told. However, I believe that I spoke to XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX and XXXX before speaking with XXXX XXXX and both my wife and I believe that XXXX XXXX explained the diagnostic coding problem to me and indicated that the problem would be resolved when the correct coding was added to the claim papers. I made the assumption that the XXXX administrative staff would resolve the problem. Evidently this was an erroneous assumption. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I received a collection notice from Credit Collection Services ( CCS ) seeking the unpaid amount of {$230.00}. On XX/XX/XXXX I spoke to someone from XXXX who agreed that incorrect diagnostic codes were the likely cause of the problem, and that they would contact XXXX to resolve the matter. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I received a second notice from Credit Card Services ( CCS ). Again, I began contacting interested third parties in an attempt to resolve the matter. XXXX advised that this appeared to be a XXXX problem. XXXX suggested that XXXX submit a duplicate claim since their records indicate that all active claims have been processed. CCS was willing to accept payment but could offer no other assistance. When I called XXXX, I was asked to input my File Number which then immediately redirected my call back to CCS. 

I tried contacting XXXX directly, except I did not provide a claim number. This put me through to an employee ( XXXX? ) who was helpful. He advised that the ordering physician XXXX XXXX XXXX ) would need to provide correct or additional diagnostic codes in order to process the claim. 

I called XXXX XXXX again and he affirmed the need for XXXX XXXX to provide correct or additional diagnostic codes. He also indicated that he would be willing to provide whatever assistance he could but that he was legally barred from establishing the codes himself. 

I then prepared an email summary of events and sent it to XXXX XXXX with a request that she work with XXXX XXXX to provide XXXX with whatever information they need? I was contacted by XXXX of XXXX administrative staff ( XXXX? XXXX ) on XX/XX/XXXX and she advised me that she would contact XXXX in an effort to resolve the matter. XXXX contacted me again about a week later to advise that she was unable to resolve the matter because no one at XXXX could talk to her because the matter had been forwarded to CCS, and no one at CCS could help because their function was to collect the debt not to resolve billing problems. 

Thanks again for your help.

75,"I went with XXXX to pay for college. I went with a variable rate, as I didnt have much choice. The interest rate started low ( which is still high ) at 11 %, but over the years they pushed it up to 12 %. I called them before the pandemic about what to do to get the rate down and I was told tough luck. I have always payed my loans on time, and I pay more than the minimum payment. Ive noticed in the past couple months that they have jacked up my interest. Last month it was 13 % and this month is 14 %. I owe XXXX on the loan and they are making it extremely difficult to successfully pay it off.

77,"On XXXX I received a message on my phone claiming to be wells fargo. they wanted me to review suspicious charges on my account. knowing that these calls can be spoofed I hung up and called wells fargo. while the wells fargo support person was looking into my account I notice that {$4000.00} was transferred to my account from my wife 's account, and then my whole account was drained of {$10000.00}. I made them aware of the transaction immediately and started the process of opening a claim to retrieve my money. Wells Fargo then gave me a case number and opened two new account numbers for me and my wife and closed the original accounts. the case was denied and I was told that the reasoning is that they said I was the one who did it. which in no way is true. they literally got every penny I have leaving me without a way to support my family. when I got the letter saying the case was denied, I requested that they reopen the case and escalate it to XXXX. they even went to the extreme to blame me for the transaction. they took over three weeks to resolve it again and once again they denied it. I was not given the courtesy of a phone call that was promised to me which is very unprofessional. I am unwilling to forfeit what seems like a non important amount to a XXXX dollar company. I am ready to take this to a lawyer, but id rather fix it at this level. I beleive all Wells Fargos calls are recorded so they should have the call I made initially to try and stop this from happening recorede. Im looking to have this resolved immediately."
78,I am not liable for this debt with Credit Collection Service. They did not provide me with the original contract like I asked.

80,"Dear Madam/Sirs, I am in receipt of yet another Collection Notice dated XX/XX/XXXX from Radius Global Solutions XXXX Consequently, on multiple occasions throughout the past Four ( 4 ) years I have made many diligent attempts to resolve this matter on my behalf. I have made contact with Radius Global Solutions and XXXX XXXX a XXXX via multiple phone calls, written letters and emails. I have provided multiple forms of Proof that I purchased Rental Car Protection and an XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for the vehicle. This is my FINAL attempt to resolve this issue favorably on my behalf. 

On the day of the incident there was a large nail impaled in the tire of the rental vehicle which lead to a flat tire. I immediately contacted the XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and they advised me to return the vehicle back to the rental facility. Pursuant to their request I immediately complied and returned the vehicle to the facility. Upon my arrival at the rental facility I was given a replacement vehicle. Additionally, I was informed by the XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX Agent that the Flat Tire is in fact covered under the Rental Car Protection Plan as well as the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX that I had purchased at the time of the rental. 

The Car Protection Plan was purchased online through XXXX XXXX XXXX, The Car Protection Plan was insured by the XXXX XXXX Assistance Insurance Company. By the way, I paid an additional fee of {$8.00} daily for a period of 8 days, totaling {$72.00} insurance for the entire week. This fee was fully paid on XX/XX/XXXX via my XXXX Credit Card ending in # XXXX. The fee also included an XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

Consequently, I had previously resolved this matter Four ( 4 ) years ago when this incident initially occurred. I immediately contacted XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX and the XXXX XXXX XXXX. The XXXX XXXX XXXX informed me that the Flat Tire was indeed fully covered under the Car Protection Plan that I had purchased through them and they further informed that this matter had been completely resolved. I then contacted XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  by both phone and email, whereupon, I informed them that the matter was being resolved by the XXXX XXXX XXXX and that they would receive a check from XXXX for the flat tire. 

Furthermore, XXXX XXXX XXXX informed me that they would be sending a Check to XXXX XXXX a Car in the amount of {$180.00} to cover both the cost of the labor and the new tire. If, in fact, XXXX XXXX a XXXX never received the check then they need to contact the XXXX XXXX XXXX who assured me that they issued the insurance check to them. They should not be contacting ME about this. 

Now, nearly four ( 4 ) years later this nightmare is coming back to haunt me. I just received another collection notice form Radius Global Solutions, LLC., Nearly FOUR ( 4 ) YEARS after this issue was allegedly resolved. I was quite dumbfounded to say the least. This is completely unfair, unjust and simply ludicrous. I am tired of this lack of competence by this company 's disinterest and efforts to resolve this matter in my favor. 

As a result, I am now in Collections by no fault of my own. I am being overcharged by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for a bill that has already been PAID IN FULL. The XXXX XXXX XXXX had already sent them a check to cover the new tire and they are attempting to collect the same fees from me. This is Fraudulent and illegal. Why are they charging the fee twice?? They were already paid by XXXX XXXX XXXX. I will not be manipulated into making additional payments for fees that have already been paid by the Car Protection Plan and the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX that I previously paid for at the time of the rental. ( See Documents/Proof attached to this email ). 

I am continually being harassed by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and Radius Global Solutions, XXXX, for fees that were already paid by the Protection Plan and Supplemental XXXX XXXX I am respectfully requesting that any and all correspondence in this matter cease and desist forthwith. I am being falsely targeted and harassed and this is a XXXX XXXX that will not be tolerated. This matter is causing me severe distress. 

I am extremely annoyed and frustrated. I should NOT be in collections. I had purchased a Car Protection Plan and as well as an XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX which is an inclusive Policy to cover any and all possible damages and/or liabilities for the rental vehicle. This XXXX was a Full XXXX XXXX and was in full force and effect for the duration of the car rental period from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. The vehicle was returned in excellent condition. The only issue I had was the Flat Tire which was repaired and covered under the Car Protection Plan and the Supplemental Insurance that I had previously purchased and PAID FOR IN FULL. 

The XXXX Rent a Car Agreement Invoice and the Rental Car Protection Plan Invoice dated XX/XX/XXXX. These documents/invoices clearly indicate that I purchased the XXXX XXXX XXXX as well as supplemental Insurance for my rental vehicle during the period noted above. 

This matter is purely bogus. If this matter is not resolved in an expedient fashion, They are attempting to collect fees that have already been paid by XXXX XXXX. I am tired of the harassment, false implications and the duress that this matter has been causing me since XXXX. 

Thank you for your assistance and efforts in this matter. It is with great hope that this matter is immediately resolved in my favor. 

Please find attached to this complaint XXXX ( XXXX ) Forms of Proof that I did purchase Car Protection Insurance as well as XXXX XXXX Liability for the Rental Vehicle. 

Respectfully submitted, XXXX XXXX XXXX"

88,"I am in the process of mortgage assistance and am hoping for a loan modification but Wells Fargo has sent me notice they will no longer service the loan as of XX/XX/XXXX. The company taking over, XXXX XXXX has horrible reviews and I believe it is within reasonable expectations for Wells Fargo to complete the modification immediately rather than pass the proverbial buck. 
This has been a long drawn out process and I have proven my income & ability to make monthly payments several times this year. If Wells Fargo refuses to expedite this matter I will be forced to take legal action to get damages due for several illegal handling instances of this mortgage as outlined in previous complaints ( filed with XXXX as email ). 
It is time Wells Fargo escalate this matter to executive management and close the deal for me in good faith rather than leave me hanging and in distress unnecesarily. If they do not finish the job that needs to be done there is no reason a new company, with a horrible reputation of handling customer issues, should be expected to do so.

Wells Fargo says that PIN was used in the fraud but checking it personally out and talking to the gas station personel PIN can be bypassed at the pump.We took pictures how you can BYPASS the PIN. 
In Washington State almost all the pumps have the BYPASS PIN option when you are using the gas pump and pretty sure that even the person that reads this complain is aware of the BYPASS option. 
Wells Fargo claims that the person that used the debit card entered a PIN.Why would someone enter a PIN or try to enter a PIN when you push the BYPASS PIN button when you have a cloned card? or whatever they used to fraud our card/account. 
We went at that gas station and we took pictures of the BYPASS PIN option. 
Wells Fargo refuses to pay the claim and they are lying that the PIN was used. 
PIN was BYPASSED. 
Please investigate this.Wells Fargo has a very bad reputation and its very well known that they are constantly lying and refuse to pay claims. 
The bypass pun option was used with multiple debit cards plus Wells Fargo and its a option fir all the debit cards.Please call the gas station and the staff there will confirm that.Thank you"

They deflect you from the reality of these random fees. I just want to pay off my initial balance thats all. I spend hours on the phone but again, no resolution. They now opened an investigation regarding the late fees and autopay but not the promotional balance I just now found out about. From my experience. I think theyre going to sweep this under the rug like theyve done with my other complaints. They also, randomly enrolled me into this insurance monthly fee scammed that I was unknowingly paying for each month. They credited it all back on my account amounting to {$740.00}.

98,"On XX/XX/2021 I ordered a phone from XXXX. I was told the phone would have either a XXXX or XXXX day ship, but it took longer than that. I reached out multiple times to XXXX and spoke to multiple representatives. In the beginning I was told my order did not ship out yet, then that it just shipped, and lastly that they couldnt find my order at all. After hearing all of this I was frustrated and decided do cancel the entire order. I called XXXX & was told that the order was already shipped and told to contact XXXX. When I called XXXX, they stated that they havent received my order at all. I then spoke to XXXX  again and they gave me the run around. I was then told that the order was canceled and I had nothing to worry about. XXXX went by and I noticed XXXX XXXX tried to take different amounts of money from my account at different times. I visited my local XXXX and they called the collection agency and tried to get everything disputed. Before I left I was told by the XXXX experts that everything was handled and that the debt would be disputed and removed from my credit report. That never happened. I went back a little while later and did the whole process over with XXXX The agency told the experts that they did in fact dispute my claim but they put it back on my credit report due to phone usage & the phone account being used. Again I told both XXXX and the agency that I did not receive the phone, it was NEVER delivered to my home, due to me canceling it. I told them that when I spoke to the representatives I was told my order was successfully cancelled. I told them again and again that I do not have possession of the phone or any of XXXX equipment. Im not the individual that used nor opened the account etc. The XXXX representatives even stated to the agency that they have no active account in my name, and that its obvious Im not the one using the device or the account. The {$560.00} was then removed from my credit report for about a couple of months, & it is now back. I just want to get this handled. This has been going on for way too long."
