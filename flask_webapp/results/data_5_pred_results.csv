,Complaints,Monetary or not?
1,"A fraudulent charge was made on the card and soon after reported. The fraudulent claim was denied and claimed the item was delivered to my address, which is false. 

I never made a purchase anywhere near the date of the transaction and never received a delivery after the date of the transaction. 

I was never contacted during the investigation and was only sent a denial letter. 

The card is less than a year old and all purchases were made either online or at our local XXXX 's store. The fraud is likely an internal issue among XXXX 's employees or their affiliates. 

FYI, we have purchased nearly {$20000.00} using this Lowe 's credit card during the 6 months or card ownership and the fraudulent portion was for {$340.00}, fraudulently charged well after the competition of our purchases.",0
2,"I have been working with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX since XX/XX/2022 to pay my debts.I 'm on Social Security XXXX and ran into some problems financially, this XXXXXXXX XXXX has been receiving payments monthly since XXXX granted they are late I do not get paid until the XXXX monthly from Social Security. And the funds go through XXXX XXXX, then sent onto Fortiva. I contacted XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX to ask for a date change for my payments so they aren't late anymore ( to stop their late fees and over the limit fees ) they refused. This account will never get caught up if they do not help with changing the payment dates, and refunding of late fees, and over limit fees, ( over limit fees that they created by changing me late payment charges ). I can NOT change my pay date it's straight across the board from the Government! They also refused to offer any hardship payment plan to me!",0
3,Credit acceptance closed this account on my credit report then opened it back as late payments this information is incorrect and is illegal on how it is posted on my report. I have wrote them a certified letter twice asking them to remove this with no response for over 60 days.,0
4,"On Saturday XXXX, I received a Netspend XXXX XXXX pre-paid XXXX This card includes an account and a mailer to sign up for Direct Deposit, which included a routing number and an account number. When I called the company on XXXX, their phone system lead me in circles. When I looked on their website, they did not list any phone numbers that would actually route me to a person. The phone system wanted me to activate the card before anyone would help me. So, I routed through the phone system to report a lost or stolen card before I could speak to a person. When I did speak to a person, they wanted me to activate this card, even though I did not request it. I had to request to speak to a supervisor to find out who requested the card account on my behalf. The supervisor said that it was a promotional item, and they just send these cards to randomly selected people. I explained that this was deceptive marketing, and it was fraudulent because they sent out a completely encoded XXXX with my name, and active magnetic strip. I had to request the company cancel this card as well as the account, to remove me from all future mailing, to not give or sell my information to anyone, and to remove my information from their database. This is very deceptive and could defraud many people.",0
5,"I request you provide me with proof of this alleged payment being late. if unable to provide or lacking proof of this payment being late, update payment history to paid as agreed never late ( PAANL ) Please provide detailed description of all procedures used in your process to determine complete accuracy of information once you have finished your investigation, send me an update credit report to the address above",0
